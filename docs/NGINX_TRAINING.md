# NGINX Training Outline

The following topics help developers and SREs operate NGINX effectively.

1. **Basic architecture** – request flow, worker model, modules.
2. **Key directives** – `proxy_pass`, caching, rate limiting, TLS settings.
3. **CI/CD workflow** – how configuration changes are validated and deployed.
4. **Troubleshooting** – reading logs, using `nginx -t`, and common errors.
5. **Security practices** – OWASP CRS, HSTS, certificate management.

New hires go through this material during onboarding. Practical exercises are carried out directly on the production instance with all necessary safeguards.
