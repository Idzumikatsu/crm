# NGINX Design

## Target Architecture

The solution runs inside Docker Compose. Traffic from clients first hits
NGINX which proxies requests to the Spring Boot application. The
application communicates with PostgreSQL. NGINX exposes its metrics via a
Prometheus exporter container.

```
Client ---> NGINX ---> App ---> PostgreSQL
                  |
                  --> Prometheus Exporter
```

NGINX is deployed as a standalone service in front of the application.
Load balancing between multiple application instances will use the default
`round_robin` strategy. Clients today support HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, so we
plan to enable HTTP/2 on the public interface. HTTP/3 is not required yet.

Releases of NGINX configuration follow a blueâ€‘green strategy to minimise
risk. The approved architecture and these decisions are now recorded in
this design document.
